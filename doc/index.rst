============================
 Configuration With ZConfig
============================

ZConfig is a Python library for creating extensible configuration
documents (files). The configuration documents are written in a syntax
reminiscent of that used by the Apache HTTP Server, while the configuration
mechanism is itself configured using a schema specification written
in XML.

ZConfig is used by projects such as the Zope application server and
ZODB, and is easily used by other projects. ZConfig only relies on the
Python standard library.

For information on reading and writing configuration documents, see
:doc:`using-zconfig`.

For information on using ZConfig to create custom configurations for
you projects, see :doc:`developing-with-zconfig`.

Development of ZConfig is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/zopefoundation/ZConfig>`_.
